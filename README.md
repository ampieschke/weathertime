--- PROJECT PURPOSE ---
The purpose of this project is to create a functional weather app using API calls.

--- HOW IT WORKS ---
GIVEN a weather dashboard with a form input
WHEN you search for a city
THEN you am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city
THEN you am presented with the city name, the date, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN you view the UV index
THEN you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city
THEN you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date,the temperature, and the humidity
